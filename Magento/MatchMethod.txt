The match function in "/app/code/core/Mage/Core/
Controller/Varien/Router/Standard.php" is a method of the one of
four main router classes in Magento - the Standart router.
The Standard router is the object used to handle frontend Magento area.
Actually the Standart router as router object has three main responsibilities:

  1. Provide a "match" method which functionality I will describe.

  2. Mark the request object as dispatched.

  3. Set the body/contents of the request object.

The goal of  Standard router objectâ€™s match method is to examine a request URL and
based on its component parts determine which Magento module might contain an appropriate controller,
then choose the most appropriate controller in the module we should use, after that
determine which controller's action should be called, and finally tell the controller to dispatch that action.

If the request object for a module name returns nothing, the Magento
takes URL, for example, "http://127.0.0.1:8888/magento/catalog/category/view/id/8", and splits it into next components:
  1) "catalog"
  2) "category"
  3) "view"
  4) "id"
  5) "8"
Then "catalog" is set to be a module name, "category" - controller name, "view" - action. When we got our "module name" +
+ "controller name" + "action" Magento checks if this place (./madule_name/controller_name/action) is secure.
If everything is okey and controller class has been instantiated then the "id" parameter is set to "3" and
action is dispatched.
(If the URL is empty like this "http://127.0.0.1:8888/", Magento will take default path information.
This is where CMS Index Controller starts to act.)
